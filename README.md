# Software
*HOW DO I CONTROL THIS THING?*

## Custom Python code *IF APPLICABLE*
We also provide a code example for driving the device using a python driver. Please refer to the code and the package in the folder [PYTHON](./PYTHON).

## *CUSTOM FANCY SOFTWARE*
We also provide *SOME SORCERY* for driving the device. Find the files in folder [*MY_AWESOME_SOFTWARE*]().

# Hardware

Below we describe how the device can be build and assembled in order to replicate the whole system as shown in the rendering above. One needs additional parts that can be found in the core [openUC2 repository](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT).


## Bill of material

Below you will find all components necessary to build this device

### 3D printing files

All these files need to be printed. We used a Prusa i3 MK3 using PLA Prusament (Galaxy Black) at layer height x.x mm and infill xx%.

## License and Collaboration

This project is open-source and is released under the CERN open hardware license. Our aim is to make the kits commercially available.
We encourage everyone who is using our Toolbox to share their results and ideas, so that the Toolbox keeps improving. It should serve as a easy-to-use and easy-to-access general purpose building block solution for the area of STEAM education. All the design files are generally for free, but we would like to hear from you how is it going.

You're free to fork the project and enhance it. If you have any suggestions to improve it or add any additional functions make a pull-request or file an issue.
